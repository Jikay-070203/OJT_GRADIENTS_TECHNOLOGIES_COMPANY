🚀 Project Refactoring & Model Deployment Updates

🎯 Main Requirements
Use the Trism library to replace TritonClient: [Trism GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hieupth/trism)  
Replace the model serving structure with the repository: [TritonServer GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hieupth/tritonserver)  

### Purpose:
✅ Store the model on Hugging Face, allowing it to be automatically downloaded each time the Docker image hosts the model.  
✅ Use a lighter TritonServer image for improved efficiency.


📌 This week, the project will be divided.
📌 Today, you need to refactor the code before transitioning to the new project:

✅ Replace tritonclient with trism (GitHub - trism).
✅ Change the model serving structure using hieupth/tritonserver.

🎯 Objectives
🔹 Store models on Hugging Face for automatic download when running the Docker image hosting the model.
🔹 Use a lighter Triton Server image for improved performance.

📖 Detailed Explanation of Requirements
You aim to enhance the deployment of machine learning models using Triton Inference Server with three main goals:

🔹 1. Simplify Interaction with Triton Server
🚀 Replace tritonclient with trism (GitHub - trism).

📌 Why?
✅ trism simplifies inference requests to Triton Server.
✅ Makes the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

🔹 2. Automate Model Storage & Loading from Hugging Face Hub
💾 Instead of manually managing models, integrate Hugging Face Hub:
✅ Store models on Hugging Face Hub for easy sharing and updates.
✅ Auto-download models when running the Docker image.
✅ Always use the latest model version without manual updates.
✅ Use hieupth/tritonserver to automate loading models from Hugging Face.

🔹 3. Reduce Triton Server Docker Image Size
🐳 Use a lighter Docker image for Triton Server to:
✅ Reduce download time.
✅ Save storage space.
✅ Improve overall performance.

📌 The hieupth/tritonserver repository provides optimizations for a smaller Triton Server image.

✅ Summary of Key Changes
🔹 🔄 Replace tritonclient with trism for easier interaction with Triton Server.
🔹 💾 Enable auto-download of models from Hugging Face Hub using hieupth/tritonserver.
🔹 📉 Optimize the Triton Server Docker image for better efficiency.

🔧 Implementation Steps
📌 1️⃣ Learn & Install trism
📍 Read the documentation and examples from trism GitHub.
📍 Understand how to send inference requests using trism.
📍 Install trism:


pip install trism
📌 2️⃣ Understand Hugging Face Hub
📍 Get familiar with Hugging Face Hub and how to store models there.
📍 Learn about Hugging Face libraries for model management:
✅ transformers
✅ huggingface_hub

📌 3️⃣ Explore hieupth/tritonserver Repository
📍 Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/hieupth/tritonserver.git
cd tritonserver
📍 Study the documentation to understand how models are loaded from Hugging Face.
📍 Identify key configuration files and scripts for integration.

📌 4️⃣ Modify Model Serving Structure
📍 Replace the current model serving structure with hieupth/tritonserver.
📍 Configure files to load models from Hugging Face Hub.
📍 Ensure Triton Server correctly loads and serves models.

📌 5️⃣ Integrate trism into the Application
📍 Replace tritonclient calls with equivalent trism functions.
📍 Test inference requests to confirm correct functionality.

📌 6️⃣ Build a New Lightweight Docker Image
📍 Modify the Dockerfile to use hieupth/tritonserver.
📍 Ensure all required dependencies are installed:
✅ trism
✅ transformers
✅ huggingface_hub

📍 Build and test the Docker image:


docker build -t my-triton-server .
📍 Compare the new image size with the previous version.

📌 7️⃣ Test & Deploy
📍 Verify all components:
✅ Triton Server
✅ Inference requests
✅ Model loading from Hugging Face

📍 Deploy the new Docker image in the production environment.

⚠️ Important Notes
🚀 This process requires knowledge of:
🔹 Docker
🔹 Triton Inference Server
🔹 Hugging Face Hub
🔹 Python

📌 Start with a simple model, then scale up.
📌 Hugging Face account is required to store and manage models.
📌 Refer to documentation and examples from relevant projects for additional guidance.
