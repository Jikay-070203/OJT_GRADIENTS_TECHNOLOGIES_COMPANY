# Comparing YOLOv8 Models: `best.pt` vs `best.torchscript`

## ðŸ”¹ `best.pt` â€“ Original PyTorch Model

- **Format**: `.pt` (PyTorch)
- **Usage**: Training (`train`), validation (`val`), and inference (`predict`) with YOLOv8
- **Requirements**: Requires an environment with PyTorch + Ultralytics YOLO
- **Characteristics**:
  - Contains the full model architecture + weights
  - Can be further trained
  - Can be converted to other formats such as ONNX, TorchScript, TFLite, OpenVINO, etc.
- **Best for**: Development, training, or model evaluation

## ðŸ”¹ `best.torchscript` â€“ Frozen TorchScript Model

- **Format**: `.torchscript` (TorchScript â€“ a serialized model format of PyTorch)
- **Usage**: Fast model deployment in Python applications or C++ environments (PyTorch runtime)
- **Requirements**: PyTorch runtime (does not require YOLOv8 CLI)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Cannot be further trained
  - Converted into a static computation graph
  - Runs faster, lightweight, and independent of Ultralytics
- **Best for**: Embedding the model into applications where no modifications or further training are needed
