# Model Comparison: `v1_CLI` vs `v2_API`

## 🔹 Model Differences

- **`v1_CLI`**: Trained without extensive image rotation, making it suitable for testing with frontal and slightly tilted angles.
- **`v2_API`**: Trained with 45-degree image rotations, enabling better learning and improved recognition of tilted angles compared to `v1_CLI`.

## ⚡ Ease of Use & Speed

- **CLI**: Quick to execute commands.
- **API**: Requires writing code but offers better flexibility.

## 🔍 Flexibility & Debugging

- **CLI**: Limited customization and harder to debug.
- **API**: More flexible for debugging and modifications.

## 🔗 Integration

- **API**: Easily integrates into web apps, large systems, or automated pipelines.
- **CLI**: Less flexible for integration into large-scale systems.
