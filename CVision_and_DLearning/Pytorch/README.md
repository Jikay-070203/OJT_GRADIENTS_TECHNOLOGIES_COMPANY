## 📘 `00_pytorch_fundamentals.ipynb`

**Introduction to Tensors**

- Create and manipulate tensors (reshape, indexing).
- Perform arithmetic operations, convert between NumPy ↔ Tensor.
- Use GPU and autograd.

---

## 🛠️ `01_PyTorch_workflow.ipynb`

**Model Training Workflow**

- Generate sample data and build a simple linear model.
- Manual training: forward → loss → backward.
- Evaluate model accuracy.

---

## 👚 `02_pytorch_classification.ipynb`

**FashionMNIST Image Classification**
