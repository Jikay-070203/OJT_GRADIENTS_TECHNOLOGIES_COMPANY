# 🧠 VGG16 - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification

This notebook demonstrates how to use the **VGG16 architecture** for image classification using PyTorch.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside?

- Load and preprocess image dataset.
- Use pretrained `VGG16` model from `torchvision.models`.
- Customize the classifier head for your dataset.
- Train, validate, and evaluate model performance.
- Visualize training metrics and predictions.

---

## 📷 Model: VGG16

- Developed by Oxford's Visual Geometry Group.
- Deep CNN with 16 layers.
- Famous for its simplicity and effectiveness in image tasks.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

2. Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook VGG16.ipynb
```

3. Customize number of output classes if needed.

## 📝 Notes

- You can fine-tune the pretrained weights or freeze early layers.
- Replace the final layer for your specific classification task.
- Ensure your dataset is structured for PyTorch's `ImageFolder`.
